This is the first proper release of `ioes`. In preparation for go 1.13, in which `go.mod` files and go modules are the primary way to handle go dependencies, we are going to do an official release of all our modules. This will be version v0.1.0 of `ioes`.


### Bug Fixes

* **PrintErr:** add method for printing to error output ([0c44c82](https://github.com/qri-io/ioes/commit/0c44c82))
